    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a no frills New York Pizza with heaps of mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. Use it as a base and add your
        favorite pizza toppings if you wish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the warm water in a large bowl. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir to
            dissolve. Mix in the flour, salt and olive oil. When the dough is too thick to stir, turn out onto a floured
            surface, and knead for 5 minutes. Knead in a little more flour if the dough is too sticky. Place into an
            oiled bowl, cover, and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven as well,
            setting it on the lowest shelf.</li>
        <li>When the dough has risen, flatten it out on a lightly floured surface. Roll or stretch out into a 12 inch
            circle, and place on a baking pan. If you are using a pizza stone, you may place it on a piece of parchment
            while preheating the stone in the oven.

        </li>
        <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough. Sprinkle with oregano, mozzarella cheese, basil, Romano
            cheese and red pepper flakes.

        </li>
        <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottom of the crust is browned when you lift up
            the edge a little, and cheese is melted and bubbly. Cool for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
        </li>

    </ol>
